## Changelog: Model 'ana-cont' (Value by angle)

### 19.00 - 25-AUG-2025
* Use same resize algorithm (mitchell-cubic) than in real environment (stb image library)
* Train models using resized images loaded from RAM (instead of saving + loading from file, now part of training notebook)
* Add new image duplicate filter function by image hash analysis (perceptual hash)
* Harmonize and align processing pipeline for both algorithms by usage of centralized functions (easier to maintain)
* Save false predicted file list (csv label file) in 'modern syntax' (Label verification / adjustment by using [collectmeteranalog](https://github.com/haverland/collectmeteranalog?tab=readme-ov-file#label-file-syntax) by haverland)
* Adapt GitHub Action to updated training pipeline
* Retrained models based on actual images dataset (new images added, provided by `#3892`, removed duplicates)
* Moved outdated models to archive folder
